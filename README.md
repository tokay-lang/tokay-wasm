# Tokay (WASM)

This is the web-assembly package of the [Tokay programming language](https://tokay.dev) for NPM.

Tokay is a programming language designed for ad-hoc parsing. It is written in Rust, and can be found officially [here](https://github.com/tokay-lang/tokay).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tokay (WASM) is in an early project state, therefore things on the package as well as the bindings may change!
> The package is kept synchronous to the current Tokay release version.

## Usage

```js
import { run } from 'tokay';

console.log(run("Int * 3", "123 456 789"));
// (369, 1368, 2367)
```

## Build & publish

Althought this crate and repo is called `tokay-wasm`, the released npm package is called just `tokay`.

Invoking manual builds:

- for bundlers like `vite`: `wasm-pack build --target=bundler --out-name=tokay`
- for nodejs: `wasm-pack build --target=nodejs --out-name=tokay`
- for web: `wasm-pack build --target=web --out-name=tokay`
